# Full Stack Open - University of Helsinki

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions and exercises for the [Full Stack Open 2024](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course provided by the University of Helsinki.

## Repository Structure

To keep my progress organized and easy to follow, this repository is structured by course part. Each part of the Full Stack Open course has its own dedicated folder.

Here's how it works:

* You'll find a folder for **each major section or part** of the course (e.g., `part0`, `part1`, `part2`, etc.).
* Inside each part's folder, you'll see **subfolders or files** corresponding to specific exercises or topics covered in that part.

This structure allows for clear separation of concerns and makes it straightforward to navigate through the exercises for a particular part of the course.
